# Migrating from v4

:::danger
These docs are for the not-yet-released v5.  
For v4 docs see <https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr>
:::

- Before upgrading, you may want to back up your user abbreviations file.

    ```shell
    cp $ABBR_USER_ABBREVIATIONS_FILE ~/path/to/the/new/user-abbreviations.bk
    ```

- zsh-syntax-highlighting users who highlight abbreviations will need to update their snippets. Follow the [Reference&nbsp;>&nbsp;Advanced&nbsp;>&nbsp;Syntax highlighting](/reference/advanced.html#syntax-highlighting) instructions.
